<h2> Objective of reproduction  </h2>

The objective of this reproduction is to test whether the analysis of the contributorship mentioned in the paper can be reproduced and if similar results can be obtained while using various repositories.


<h2> Description </h2>

This paper characterizes contributor acknowledgment models in open source by analyzing thousands of projects that use a model called All Contributors. It focuses on the life cycle of projects through the model's lens and contrast its representation of contributorship. We would be reproducing the data pipeline for the list of contributors and contribution history.

<h3> Input data  </h3>

* The input data is extracted from GitHub API consisting of:

   - Forked results and fork parents 
   - Repositories list and shortlisted repositories list
   - Contributors list and size
 
<h3> Output data  </h3> 

*  We characterize contributor acknowledgment models in open source, analyze the life cycle of projects through different models.
